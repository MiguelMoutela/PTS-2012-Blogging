Pearson Technology Summit 6.0 (2012)
====================================
This project contains sample applications for the "Instant REST Services With RestExpress" workshop.

You can either 'clone' this project via:

    git clone git://github.com/tfredrich/PTS-2012-Blogging.git

Or download the zip file from the downloads area at:

https://github.com/tfredrich/PTS-2012-Blogging/downloads

Once either cloned or unzipped to your disk, you'll find two directories, "complete" and "kickstart".  In the "complete" directory is a fully-functioning example of what we'll be building during the workshop--a functional blogging service suite.

In the "kickstart" directory, is the empty shell that we'll be starting with--the RestExpress Scaffolding application.  While this has been inserted here to facilitate us getting going rapidly in the workshop, it is also available here as a stand-alone download:

https://github.com/RestExpress/RestExpress-Scaffold/downloads

Which is where you'll want to get the latest version when you create your own projects--outside of the workshop.

To run these applications, you'll need Java (1.7), Ant, and MongoDB.

* Java JDK download: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
* MongoDB download: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads
* Apache Ant download: http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
